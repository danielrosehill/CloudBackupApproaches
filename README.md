# Cloud Backup Approaches

In this repository I will endeavor to maintain up to date documentation regarding how to backup your (user) data from various commonly used cloud services providers. 

Please note: this repository is being automatically synced from Github to [Gitbook](https://danielrosehill.gitbook.io/saas-backup-approaches/). If you are accessing this from the latter, please use the menu in the left sidebar to navigate and not the table of contents below.

I am still searching for a tool that:

- Automatically exports all SaaS applications and sync them cloud-to-cloud to commonly supported object storage buckets (but especially Backblaze B2)

For my latest master backup strategy — covering both the cloud and the Linux desktop — [please visit this repository](https://github.com/danielrosehilljlm/Master_Backup_Strategy). 

If you have feedback or would like to contribute to the summaries, please be in touch.
